The ShellHub is a lightweight software component that runs the device and provide communication between the device and ShellHub's server. Its main role is to provide a reserve SSH server always connected to the ShellHub server, allowing SSH connections to be established to the device even when it is behind a firewall or NAT.

## Features

- **Secure Communication:** The agent establishes encrypted connections between remote devices and the ShellHub server, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity during communication.

- **Device Registration:** Upon installation on a new device, the agent registers it with the ShellHub server, making it accessible and manageable from the web interface.

- **Authentication and Access Control:** The agent handles user authentication, allowing administrators to enforce access control based on user credentials and defined permissions.

- **Session Management:** The agent manages SSH sessions initiated by users, providing secure remote access to registered devices through the ShellHub web interface.

- **Heartbeat and Health Checks:** The agent sends regular heartbeat signals to the ShellHub server, indicating its status and health, facilitating device availability monitoring.
