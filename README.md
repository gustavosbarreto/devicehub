ShellHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices
via command line (using any SSH client) or web-based user interface, 
designed as an alternative to _sshd_. Think ShellHub as centralized SSH
for the the edge and cloud computing.

A hosted version of ShellHub is available at https://shellhub.io/.
